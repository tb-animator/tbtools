# tb-tools
toms animation tools!

This set of tools is a compilation of pretty much all that I use on a day to day basis. Hopefully it will save you some time as well!


installation:
Download the zip file
make a new folder in your user/maya folder (or somewhere else)
if you dont have one, make a folder called modules in user/maya/
copy tbtools.mod there
edit the file paths to reflect your user directory,eg.
  C:\Users\*userName*\Documents\maya\tbtools\
  C:\Users\bill.s.preston\Documents\maya\tbtools\
  
when you load maya, in the script editor you should see
****************************************************************
tb-tools module loading\n"
****************************************************************

joy!
