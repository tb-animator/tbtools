# tb-tools
toms animation tools!

This set of tools is a compilation of pretty much all that I use on a day to day basis. Hopefully it will save you some time as well!


installation:
Download the zip file

Extract it to wherever you like.
Drag the .Mel file into the main maya window and restart Maya.

when you load maya, in the script editor you should see
****************************************************************
tb-tools module loading\n"

joy!
